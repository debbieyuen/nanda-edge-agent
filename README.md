## Requirements
* Personal Computer:
  * [JetPack SDK 6.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-61) (make sure you are not downloading JetPack 5.1.3 from the Jetson AI Docs! It will give you an error when trying to boot)
  * Need a computer to flash to the Jetson
  * Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit - JetPack 5.1.3 image

## Set Up
### Step 1
Install [NVIDIA JetPack SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack). We are currently working with [JetPack 6.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-61) and a microSD Card of 1 TB. In order to download, you will need to sign into your [NVIDIA account](https://developer.nvidia.com/account). The SDK Manager needs to meet the minimum requirements of screen resolution equal or larger than 1440x900. Once you have the SDK Manager, log in to your NVIDIA Developer account. After signing in, you will see a screen displaying informatioin about your system configuration including your **host machine** and your **target hardware** in our case we will be working with the Jetson AGX Orin modules but will continue with the microSD way of setting up. 

### Step 2
Next, we can get started with setting up our hardware! If you have the Jetson Orin Nano from the Developer Kit, you will need to upgrade to the latest firmware. This is because the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit comes with an old firmware flashed at the factory, which is NOT compatible with JetPack 6.x.
Therefore, you must upgrade to the latest firmware, before inserting SD card flashed with JetPack 6.x image (unless the firmware previuosly updated). Additional instructions are listed [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit#prepare).

### Step 3
Download the SD card image onto your PC. Here, we will be using JetPack 5.1.3 Image. Use [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io) to flash image to SD card.
In your terminal, if you do not see your microSD card anymore after flashing, you can run the following commands to check if the flash and verification process were successful. 

```bash
diskutil list
```

In my case, my microSD was `/dev/disk16 (external, physical)`. To eject I did the following: 

```bash
diskutil eject /dev/disk16
```

### Step 4
Complete the setup process and install the needed tools including Python, Chromium, Git, and GitLFS. 

On my hardware, Chromium did not open correctly. Running the commands below gave me `E: Package 'chromium' has no installation candidate`.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y chromium
```

To reinstall Chromium, I ran the following commands in my Terminal. 

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y flatpak
sudo flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub http://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak remotes
```

Install Chromium
```bash
sudo flatpak install -y flathub org.chromium.Chromium
flatpak run org.chromium.Chromium
```

After installing Chromium, install an IDE of your choice. I will be working with PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.

If you do not have git, to install git: 
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

Install Python
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv build-essential python3-dev
```


### Step 5
To create a new agent, start with NANDA's main repository. Create a fork of the NANDA repository and clone your forked repo.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/projnanda/adapter
```
